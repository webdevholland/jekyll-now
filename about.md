Hello! :wave: I'm a data analyst, mom and wife trying to make it a little easier to track my progress as I take on [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) and [#100DaysOfFitness](https://www.100daysofx.com/) challenges... so I decided to start this blog! I was previously keeping track of these challenges at different sites, but will blog about both here instead.

I decided to title this blog *Bit Of X* not only as a nod to #100DaysOfX, but also as a gentle reminder to myself that change can happen gradually, like small building blocks. I also like how "bit" can mean both a little amount of anything as well as the smallest unit of computer data.

### More Information

Below were the logs I was previously updating:
* [100 Days Of Code - Log](https://github.com/webdevholland/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md#100-days-of-code---log)
* [100 Days Of Fitness - Log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11T8-AI0RzqrGjwh-CO2cs4mVpR3vsYsXwRTe9I3CGDc/edit?usp=sharing)

The header profile photo is by [phil sheldon ABIPP](https://unsplash.com/@sploshd?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/Xpihv46a5bc). I cropped the original Unsplash photo and then optimized it with [Jpeg.io](https://www.jpeg.io/).

Two GitHub cheat sheets I refer to when working on this blog are:
* [Adam Pritchard's Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) 
* [ikatyang's Emoji Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md)

Finally, I wouldn't have been able to create this blog if it wasn't for [Barry Clark's fabulous guide at Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). Thank you so much Barry!!! :smiley:
