Hello! I'm a data analyst, mom and wife trying to make it a little easier for me to track my progress as I take on [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) and [#100DaysOfFitness](https://www.100daysofx.com/) challenges... so I decided to start this blog! I was previously keeping track of these challenges at different sites, but will blog about both here instead.

The *Bit Of X* blog title is partly a nod to #100DaysOfX. I also wanted to incorporate the word "bit" in the title because it can represent either a little amount of something or the smallest unit of computer data. While the computing reference ties in perfectly with the parts in my blog about my #100DaysOfCode progress, it's actually the first definition - "a little amount of something" - that is more meaningful to me. Because whether it's learning to code or having a more varied fitness routine, positive change can be brought about by taking small steps towards your goals.

I hope to continue updating this blog even after I completed my first rounds with the #100DaysOfCode and #100DaysOfFitness challenges. Maybe I can use this blog to help me get back to rock painting (which I love!), read more, sleep better, etc.

I'll occasionally refer to [Adam Pritchard's Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) when updating this blog.

Finally, I wouldn't have been able to create this blog if it wasn't for [Barry Clark's fabulous guide at Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). Thank you so much Barry!!!
