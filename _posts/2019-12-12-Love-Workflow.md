title: Love Jekyll & GitHub workflow
---

I think I’m hooked on using [Jekyll themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) and hosting with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I found a Jekyll theme with an elegant portfolio layout called [\*folio](http://bogoli.github.io/-folio/) by [Lia Bogoev](https://github.com/bogoli). It’s what I’m now using to showcase my [projects](https://www.webdevholland.com/portfolio/projects/).

Similar to the quick workflow process I followed to use the [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/) theme for my [blog](https://www.webdevholland.com/), setting up [\*folio](http://bogoli.github.io/-folio/) only required forking the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) and then customizing the site directly in the browser at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/). [\*folio](http://bogoli.github.io/-folio/) comes with photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) which I decided to also use as thumbnails for my [projects](https://www.webdevholland.com/portfolio/projects/).
