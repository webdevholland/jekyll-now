title: One blog for my progress in coding & fitness
---

Building my first blog site was on my list of things I to do, but I didn't think I would get around to it until later... like after completing [Brad Schiff's JavaScript course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-javascript-full-stack-from-scratch/). Fortunately, Barry Clark made it super easy for me to publish this blog today with his [awesome guide at Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).  Now instead of trying to track my [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) progress [here](https://github.com/webdevholland/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md#100-days-of-code---log) and my [#100DaysOfFitness](https://www.100daysofx.com/) progress [there](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11T8-AI0RzqrGjwh-CO2cs4mVpR3vsYsXwRTe9I3CGDc/edit?usp=sharing), I can finally blog about both on this site. Hopefully, updating only this site will help me Tweet how I'm doing with these challenges on a daily basis.

So, to get up to speed with how I've been doing with the #100DaysOfCode challenge:
* Here are some highlights from Days 79 - 93 (November 18 - December 2, 2019):
  - Continued to learn JavaScript using [Brad Schiff's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-javascript-full-stack-from-scratch/)
  - Installed and used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the first time (only used [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) before)
  - Attended a local university talk on data visualization, one of my specific interests in coding
  - Subscribed to [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA), a YouTube channel on web development and programming; watched a couple of videos there on time management and working for yourself
  - Created my first [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server
  - Listened to a [CodeNewbie podcast on freelancing](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/should-you-start-freelancing)
  - Re-installed the [Grasshopper app](https://learn.grasshopper.app/) on my phone to make any time spent waiting, like at a doctor's office, a little more productive
  - Listened to Sytax.fm podcasts on [CSS tips](https://syntax.fm/show/197/hasty-treat-tips-for-writing-good-css), [JS fundamentals](https://syntax.fm/show/162/the-fundamentals-js) and [design foundations](https://syntax.fm/show/196/design-foundations-for-developers)
  - Discovered and bookmarked [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) for hands-on data visualization practice as well as a [JavaScript guide](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript)
  - Continued to stay in touch with [Career Karma](https://careerkarma.com/) coding groups and members
* I Tweeted my progress for [Days 75 - 78](https://twitter.com/webdevholland/status/1196278451508056064), [Day 74](https://twitter.com/webdevholland/status/1195027756049993728) and [Day 73](https://twitter.com/webdevholland/status/1194540773313798144).
* The rest of my earlier progress can be found at [my old #100DaysOfCode log](https://github.com/webdevholland/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md#100-days-of-code---log).

While I haven't recently posted any updates on my #100DaysOfFitness challenge, I've still been keeping physically active:
* Some highlights from Days 18 - 89 (September 22 - December 2, 2019):
  - Got around to trying and been happily using my new pair of [Brooks Ghost 11 running shoes](https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/brooks-running-shoes-ghost-11-womens/120277.html)
  - Walking a lot more now that my new job is located far from places to eat and parking garage
  - Been steadily increasing my jogging distance as well; currently up to 2.5 miles
  - Downloaded a [pedometer app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pedometer.stepcounter.calorieburner.pedometerforwalking&hl=en_US) on my phone to track increased walking and jogging
  - Did some yoga by mainly following a [5-minute morning routine by Yoga by Candace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK92t5KI3ok&list=PLsO7f0Rn8TDQbIHEEC85lvilQWU3qXuxG&index=2); managed to change up yoga routine once following a [Yoga With Bird video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VulzDLPwJLs&list=PLsO7f0Rn8TDQbIHEEC85lvilQWU3qXuxG&index=34)
  - Continued training in mixed martial arts (MMA) 1 to 2 times a week; nervously performed [Palgwe Form 2](https://blackbeltwiki.com/palgwe-form-2) for the first time in front of other students at my dojo; and recently started weapons training using [kamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kama_(weapon))
* Days 1 - 17 of this challenge can be found at [my old #100DaysOfFitness log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11T8-AI0RzqrGjwh-CO2cs4mVpR3vsYsXwRTe9I3CGDc/edit?usp=sharing).

Admittedly, I haven't been following the two main rules of these 100-day challenges which are to code or be physically active for a minimum of an hour every day and then Tweet about it. I'll just keep doing the best that I can and plug along.
