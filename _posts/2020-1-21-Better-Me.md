title: Better Me
---

In December 2019, I completed both the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) and [#100DaysOfFitness](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23100DaysOfFitness&src=typd) challenges on Twitter! :smiley: You can learn more about these challenges by checking out these links:

* #100DaysOfCode Official Website: [https://www.100daysofcode.com/](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)
* #100DaysOfX Official Website: [https://www.100daysofx.com/](https://www.100daysofx.com/) (The “X” in this challenge can be anything you want to get better at such as fitness, art or writing, just to name a few examples.)

Participating in these challenges were great experiences for me. I highly recommend giving them a try, especially if there’s an area in your life you’d like to improve.

Here are some of the positive things I got out of [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/):

* I created [my first JavaScript app](https://codepen.io/webdevholland/full/dyyqqJM).
* I set up [my first blog](https://www.webdevholland.com/).
* I put together [my first portfolio](https://www.webdevholland.com/portfolio/).
* I got introduced to a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
* I learned to host a website using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
* I was exposed to [DNS management](https://www.dynu.com/Resources/Tutorials/DynamicDNS/DNSRecordTypes) when I was trying to point my existing domain name to my [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site.
* I made better use of my time by:
  - Listening to [Udemy JavaScript course videos](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-javascript-full-stack-from-scratch/) while driving to and from work.
  - Listening to web development podcasts by [Sytax.fm](https://syntax.fm/) while going for a jog.
  - Practicing JavaScript on the [Grasshopper app](https://grasshopper.app/) whenever I was waiting for my take-out order at a restaurant.
* I was eager to also take on [#100DaysOfFitness](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23100DaysOfFitness&src=typd).

I started [#100DaysOfFitness](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23100DaysOfFitness&src=typd) only a few days after I committed to [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) and benefitted from the second challenge in these ways:

* I discovered how wonderfully comfortable it was to jog in my new [Brooks 11 Ghost running shoes](https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/brooks-running-shoes-ghost-11-womens/120277.html).
* I slowly increased my jogging distance and was able to get up to 2.5 miles (prior to [#100DaysOfFitness](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23100DaysOfFitness&src=typd), I was doing only a moderate amount of walking and hadn’t jogged in years).
*	I downloaded a [pedometer app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pedometer.stepcounter.calorieburner.pedometerforwalking&hl=en) to my phone to not only track my jogging and walking, but to keep me motivated as well.
*	I started training with martial arts weapons called [kamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kama_(weapon)).
*	I followed along with yoga routines on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) such as:
       - [Yoga For Sleep - Easy Bedtime Yoga - 5 Minute Miracle](https://youtu.be/xP5j5U-h-jM)
       - [Morning Yoga Flow For Energy](https://youtu.be/VulzDLPwJLs)
       - [5 Minute Yoga - Morning Yoga for Beginners - Yoga With Bird](https://youtu.be/nw-TAMUWP3g)
*	Since working out on an elliptical machine, I learned to get used to its feel and settings.

There were also overall rewards that I gained from both [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) and [#100DaysOfFitness](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23100DaysOfFitness&src=typd):

*	I wrote more and in various places:
       - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/webdevholland)
       - Little journals I carried almost everywhere with me
       - [My GitHub log](https://github.com/webdevholland/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md#100-days-of-code---log)
       - [Google Docs](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11T8-AI0RzqrGjwh-CO2cs4mVpR3vsYsXwRTe9I3CGDc)
       - This [blog](https://www.webdevholland.com/)! :blush:
* I felt supported on Twitter and I got to cheer on others who were doing the same challenges.
* I was determined to keep moving forward.
* I got to try new things.

I can do additional rounds of [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) and [#100DaysOfFitness](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23100DaysOfFitness&src=typd), but, for now, I think I prefer to blog about my progress in both coding and fitness outside of the 100-day challenge construct. The 100-day challenges were the jump starts I needed though to help me in my journey towards becoming a better version of myself.
