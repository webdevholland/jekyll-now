title: One blog for my progress in coding & fitness
---

Building my first blog site was on my list of things I to do, but I didn't think I would get around to it until later... like after completing [Brad Schiff's JavaScript course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-javascript-full-stack-from-scratch/). Fortunately, Barry Clarke made it super easy for me to publish a blog today with his [awesome guide at Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).  Now instead of trying to track my [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) progress [here](https://github.com/webdevholland/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md#100-days-of-code---log) and my [#100DaysOfFitness](https://www.100daysofx.com/) progress [there](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11T8-AI0RzqrGjwh-CO2cs4mVpR3vsYsXwRTe9I3CGDc/edit?usp=sharing), I can finally blog about both just on this one site. Hopefully, updating only this site will help me be better about Tweeting my status with both 100-day challenges on a daily basis (which is one of the rules for both challenges).
