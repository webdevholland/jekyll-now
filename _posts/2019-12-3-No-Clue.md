title: No, I don't know what I'm doing
---

My husband often teases me by asking, "Do you even know what you're doing?" When it comes to this blog site, no, I have no clue what I'm doing :weary: I was able to revise my About page (easy) and then managed to figure out how to have emoji properly render (medium difficulty). Getting my own domain name to point to this GitHub Pages site was the most challenging (HARD!) Anyway, after a lot of fumbling, I finally got [webdevholland.com](http://www.webdevholland.com/) to point to this blog.
